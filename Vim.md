-> Searching in a file - 

	1. To search for an expression just type the / key and then your search result while you are in a vim session. Once you hit enter, you can press "n" to go forward or "N" to go backward in your search results.
	2. The ? search command will search the text file backwards, so in the previous example, the last pretty would come up first.
