Eg: I run the command htop. Instead of exiting normally, i press ctrl+z, which moves it to the background. To bring it to the foreground, i use the command fg.  As long as i dont logout, it stays in the background.

if we want to run a command in background append the command with '&'. For eg: htop &

to see all the running tasks in background, use the command - jobs
