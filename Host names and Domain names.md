Host names - all linux servers have a hostname. By default its ubuntu or localhost. If you want to name your hostname, just type the command "hostname"

Q. What is a hostname? 
Ans. lowest level name a server can have. 

- Domain names are completely optional and not all servers will have it. A domain name is a reference to an IP address. 
- Most common use of domain name is to name a website. 


A good analogy is, host names are like first names and domain names are like last names. 

Eg: suppose a domain name is - webserver.learnlinux.tv - here webserver is the hostname and learnlinux is the domain name and tv is top level domain. 

We can get DNS info of a server using nslookup command. Eg: nslookup learnlinux.tv
