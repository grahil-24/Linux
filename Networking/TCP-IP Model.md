Actual implementation of the OSI model. These protocols work together to specify how data should be gathered, addressed, transmitted and routed through a network. Different layers of TCP/IP Model -

1. Application Layer: 
	Top layer of the TCP/IP Model. It specifies how the computer's programs and softwares interface with the transport layer services to view the data that is being sent and recieved. 

	 This layer uses - 
	 a. HTTP - used for webpages on the internet 
	 b. SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Electronic mail transmission


2. Transport Layer:
	 How data will be transmitted, includes checking the correct ports, integrity of data and basically delivering the packets.

	This layer uses - 
	a. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol - reliable data delivery 
	b. UDP - User Datagram Protocol - unreliable data delivery

3. Network Layer:
	Specifies how to  move packets between hosts across networks. This layer uses - 
		a. IP (Internet Protocol) - Helps route packets from one machine to another
			b. ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) -Â Helps tell us what is going on, such as error messages and debugging information.

4. Link Layer - 
	Specifies how to send data across physical mediums or piece of hardware. Such as data travelling through Ethernet, Fiber etc.
